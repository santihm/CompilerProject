# Compiler Project

This project focuses on the development of a basic compiler in Java, utilizing **JFlex** and **JavaCup** to handle the essential phases of compilation: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis. The lexical analysis phase is implemented using JFlex, which generates a lexer capable of recognizing and classifying different tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals from the input source code. The syntax analysis phase is tackled with JavaCup, which is used to create a parser that checks the source code against a set of predefined grammatical rules, constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for valid programs. Finally, the semantic analysis phase ensures the code adheres to correct logical rules, such as type checking and proper handling of variables, further ensuring the validity of the program.

The project serves as both a practical introduction to compiler construction and a way to explore the tools and techniques commonly used in the field. By developing the core components of a compiler—lexer, parser, and semantic analyzer—the project provides hands-on experience with the inner workings of compilers and the challenges involved in translating high-level programming languages into machine-readable code. The use of JFlex and JavaCup facilitates the development of these components, allowing for efficient handling of tokenization and parsing while offering insights into the underlying processes of code compilation. This project is an excellent opportunity to deepen one's understanding of compiler theory and gain valuable experience with key tools in the field.
